 Enhance learning by matching K-12 content to target topics

The goal of this competition is to streamline the process of matching educational content to specific topics in a curriculum. You will develop an accurate and efficient model trained on a library of K-12 educational materials that have been organized into a variety of topic taxonomies. These materials are in diverse languages, and cover a wide range of topics, particularly in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics).

Your work will enable students and educators to more readily access relevant educational content to support and supplement learning.
